    """
    Push a film simulation recipe to a custom C-slot on the connected camera.

    The recipe's ``name`` field is used as the slot display name and must be
    non-blank (validated via recipe_to_ptp_values → validate_recipe_for_camera).

    Args:
        device:      A connected PTPDevice instance.
        recipe:      The recipe to write.  ``recipe.name`` must be a non-blank
                     string of at most 25 ASCII characters.
        slot_index:  1-based custom slot number (e.g. 1 for C1).

    Returns:
        A list of PTP property codes for which the write failed.  An empty
        list means all writes succeeded.

    Raises:
        RecipeValidationError: If any recipe field (including name) is invalid.
        CameraConnectionError: If the camera becomes unreachable during the
                               write sequence.
