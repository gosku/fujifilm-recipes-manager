    Push a film simulation recipe to a custom C-slot on the connected camera.

    The device is obtained from device_config (settings.PTP_DEVICE).
    Connection and disconnection are managed internally.

    Args:
        recipe:      The recipe to write.  ``recipe.name`` must be a non-blank
                     string of at most 25 ASCII characters.
        slot_index:  1-based custom slot number (e.g. 1 for C1).

    Raises:
        RecipeValidationError: If any recipe field (including name) is invalid.
        CameraConnectionError: If the camera becomes unreachable during the
                               write sequence.
        CameraWriteError:      If the camera rejects a critical write.
