Write operations for pushing a recipe to a Fujifilm camera over PTP/USB.

Timing requirements (must be respected to avoid camera errors):
  - 50 ms BEFORE each property write
  - 200 ms AFTER each property write
  - A liveness ping AFTER each property write
  Total: ~250 ms per property (14 props × 250 ms ≈ 3.5 s for a full recipe)
