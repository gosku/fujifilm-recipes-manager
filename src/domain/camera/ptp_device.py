Protocol and exceptions for PTP/USB camera device communication.

The PTPDevice protocol defines the interface that any concrete implementation
must satisfy.  Currently the only implementation is LibFujiDevice (ctypes
wrapper around the compiled fuji_bridge shared library).  A mock implementation
can be provided for tests without a physical camera.
