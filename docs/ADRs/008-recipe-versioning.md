# ADR 008 — Recipe versioning via generalised grouping

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-05-15

## Context

Recipes became editable in PR #38. A recipe's settings fields can now be changed through the UI. However, recipes are linked to images via a `PROTECT` foreign key (`Image.fujifilm_recipe`). Editing a recipe's settings in place would silently rewrite what settings every associated image is recorded as having been shot with — the EXIF source of truth (`FujifilmExif`) remains unchanged, creating an inconsistency between the two records of the same shot.

The only safe "edit" at the data level is to create a new `FujifilmRecipe` row with the tweaked settings and leave existing images pointing at the old row. This works for integrity but loses the relationship between the two recipes — there is no way to surface that one is an evolution of the other.

---

## Problem

How can we allow recipe evolution while:

1. Preserving the integrity of the image → recipe association (images remain linked to the exact settings they were shot with).
2. Expressing that two recipes are related — one is a deliberate tweak of the other.
3. Leaving room for a future `recipe families` concept, where recipes are grouped thematically rather than chronologically.

---

## Options considered

### Option A — Mutable recipes (status quo from PR #38)

Allow `update_settings` to mutate an existing recipe row in place.

**Why we did not choose this option:**

Every image associated with the recipe would silently acquire new settings. The `FujifilmExif` row still carries the original camera EXIF data, so the two representations of the same shot would diverge. The app has no mechanism to detect or recover from this inconsistency.

### Option B — Immutable recipes with a version-specific table

Add a `RecipeVersion` table that chains `FujifilmRecipe` rows into an ordered sequence: each row holds a FK to the previous version.

**Why we did not choose this option:**

It solves versioning but cannot express thematic grouping (families). Adding families later would require a second grouping mechanism, leaving the codebase with two overlapping models that serve similar purposes.

### Option C — Generalised recipe grouping (chosen)

Introduce two models: `RecipeGroup` (a typed container) and `RecipeGroupMember` (a through table). The `group_type` field controls the semantics — `VERSION_LINE` for chronological evolution, `FAMILY` for thematic grouping. Both needs are satisfied by the same underlying structure.

**Why this was chosen:**

A single abstraction covers both the immediate need (versioning) and the planned future need (families) without requiring a second model later. The `group_type` field keeps the two use cases distinct at the data level while sharing all the plumbing. The cost — one extra table and one denormalised field — is low.

---

## Decision

Add `RecipeGroup` and `RecipeGroupMember` to the data layer.

`RecipeGroup` carries a `group_type` (`VERSION_LINE` or `FAMILY`) and an optional `name`. For version lines the name is the stable concept identity shared across all versions; for families it is user-defined. The two names are semantically independent — individual recipe names can drift freely across versions.

`RecipeGroupMember` links a `FujifilmRecipe` to a `RecipeGroup`. It denormalises `group_type` from the group to enable a DB-level partial unique constraint (`unique_version_line_per_recipe`) that prevents a recipe from belonging to more than one version line. `position` records chronological order within a version line and is `null` for family memberships. `added_at` is the domain-layer timestamp of when the recipe joined the group (distinct from the audit `created_at`).

Creating a new version means creating a new `FujifilmRecipe` row — never mutating the old one — and appending it to the version line group at `position = max(current positions) + 1`. `Image.fujifilm_recipe` FK values are never touched.

---

## Consequences

- `FujifilmRecipe` rows remain immutable once images are associated with them. "Editing" a recipe always produces a new row.
- The existing `UniqueConstraint` on the 17 recipe settings fields is preserved — a new version must differ in at least one setting.
- A recipe can belong to at most one `VERSION_LINE` group (DB-enforced) and any number of `FAMILY` groups.
- The `group_type` field on `RecipeGroupMember` must be kept in sync with `RecipeGroup.group_type` by the domain layer on every write. This is the tradeoff for getting a DB-level partial unique index without a cross-table constraint.
- `RecipeCard` and all other existing models are unchanged.
